## SUMMARY:
The program simulates throwing darts at a dartboard
in order to approximate pi. Part A uses the drawSquare function, drawLine function, drawCircle function and setupDartboard function to setup the dartboard. throwDart function tests the code of throwing darts. Part B uses an accumulator and loop (playDarts function) to simulate a throwing dart game between two players. It also uses the throwDart function to change color depending on where the darts land on the board (green inside, red outside). Part C runs a Monte Carlo simulation (montePi function) to approximate pi with the provided formula. The isInCircle function returns a boolean value of the turtle is within the circle.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
Part C prompt asking for user to input number of darts thrown in the simulation will sometimes not register number when the user types it.
